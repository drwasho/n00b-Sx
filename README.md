n00b-Sx
=======

The goal of this project is to create a bootstrapped version of Sx for folks without much Linux or command line experience to start using Sx.

## Instructions

1. Download the scripts to a directory on Linux (use a dedicated folder)
2. Open the Linux terminal (you should at least know how to do that)
2. Navigate to the folder the scripts with the terminal // [You're welcome](http://askubuntu.com/questions/207442/how-to-add-open-terminal-here-to-nautilus-context-menu)
3. To make the scripts executable upon clicking, type the following in the terminal:

```chmod +x <filename>```

E.g.

```chmod +x miniwallet.sh```

Have fun from there.

## Scripts

**miniwallet.sh**

  Creates a new private key file, with your private key. Edit the script if you want to create a new private key file with a different name.
